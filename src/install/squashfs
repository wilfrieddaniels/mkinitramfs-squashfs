Tis hook allows the user to mount SquashFS image as root.

Image can be stored on local (or remote - read about NBD) block device
or downloaded from remote location.

List of supported protocols:
  * HTTP
  * HTTPS
  * FTP

Kernel parameters:
==================

 squashfs=<image-source>
 squashfs_copy=<image-copy>

  <image-source> can be remote or local location
  for remote location just use URL for example:

   -> squashfs=http://192.168.1.1/images/archlinux.squashfs

  for local location use DEVICE:PATH syntax for example:

   -> squashfs=/dev/sda1:/images/archlinux.squashfs
   -> squashfs=LABEL=SquashFSImages:/images/archlinux.squashfs
   -> squashfs=UUID=3c1d5e55-(...):/images/archlinux.squashfs

  It is also possible to type AUTO as PATH, then script will search for
  *first file* which name ends with .sfs or .squashfs

 <image-copy> can be one of {true, 1, 0, false} default is false

 If <image-copy> is set to true or 1, then <image-source> will be copied
 to RAM. This option is forced to true while you use remote location.

 Example with squashfs_copy:

   -> squashfs=/dev/sda1:/images/archlinux.squashfs squashfs_copy=true
 
 NOTE: After copying, you can remove device from your computer

mkinitcpio.conf
===============

 If you are going to use remote locations, add *net* (from mkinitcpio-nfs-utils)
 before *squashfs* for example:

  -> HOOKS="base udev modconf keyboard block net squashfs filesystems"

 It is also required to place *block* before squashfs if you will use
 block devices as image source.
